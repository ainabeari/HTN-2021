# HTN-2021
# Welcome to tasq!

 **tasq** is a social habit tracking web app that will keep users motivated and committed to their goals. 

## How it works

As a web application, tasq's foundation sits on HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. A Python Flask web app was built to do most of the logic in the backend. In addition data is stored on Google Cloud through firebase using node.js to launch the web page. Prior to development, Figma was used to create a HiFi wireframe to layout the design of the application. 

## User flow 

1. Using a web browser, users will be shown the main dashboard upon entering the web application. They are able to view their tasks for the day in addition to any challenges they are a part of. 
2. To view the details of a challenge, the user can click a challenge. This will take them to a challenge dashboard that summarizes the complete tasks, a ranking of the participants, the user's progress, and the incentive the group agreed upon. 
3. When the user clicks "New Challenge +" button, they will be brought to a form. This form includes text fields for the name, description, and time elements of the challenge. 
4. Once all fields are entered, users will be able to add additional participants. 
5. Upon completion of a challenge, an end-summary page will appear showing the overall progress of the challenge, the group ranking, and some data related to the challenge. 


## What's next for tasq
1. An intricate goal verification system to increase engagement and connection between members
2. Chat and social interaction features so users can complete everything within the app
3. Group incentives and a badge system 
4. Partnerships with food delivery, online banking, and shopping services to seamlessly deliver automatic prizes to the winner
